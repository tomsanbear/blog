## General

Originally from the east coast of Canada, I have lived in Toronto for most of my life for school and the first three years of my career, I am currently living in Tokyo with my partner as we both enjoy travelling surrounding Asian countries!

Some of my hobbies include:

- Cycling & Bike Packing (feel free to add me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15468359))
- Reading (see [here](/books) for more info on what I'm reading)
- Travelling (see my gallery for some photos from my various trips, WIP)
- Gaming (see my [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/tomsanbear) for what I'm currently playing)

## Career

Starting off as an Electrical Engineering Major at the University of Toronto, I originally was planning to pursue a career in the field of Telecom Hardware, but later I pivoted to Software as I fell in love with developing network and cloud applications. I have over 5 years of industry experience, working with Java, Go, Rust, Python, JS, and C/C++. In the past I have worked at:

- [PayPay Corp.](https://paypay.ne.jp/) (Software Engineer & Site Reliability Engineer) - Top Mobile Payments and Lifestyle App in Japan
- [Bluecat Networks](https://bluecatnetworks.com/) (Software Engineer & Associate Architect) - Leading provider of DNS & Network Automation
- [University of Toronto](https://bme.utoronto.ca/) (Research Associate) - Biophotonics Lab working on novel imaging techniques

My current focus is within the area of cloud native application development, in particular working with tooling and creating developer experiences that make the dev lifecycle as easy as possible!

Projects I am keeping my eye on these days include:

- Kubernetes and it's ecosystem (Service Mesh, HA Metrics Solutions, Gitops Tooling)
- Distributed Databases (CockroachDB, TiDB)
