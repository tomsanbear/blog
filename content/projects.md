Here are some of the projects that I have worked on/am working on that 

## [GigK8s](https://github.com/tomsanbear/gigk8s)

Kubernetes system to auction/offer your spare Kubernetes compute to the market.

## [Triggers](https://github.com/tomsanbear/triggers)

Automation system to map incoming webhooks from any source (Slack, Github, etc...) to predefined workflows that transform your data to other input sources (Slack, Github, etc...). Created out of lack of a bridge for Slack webhooks to trigger GH Actions.

## [CoreDNS XPF Plugin](https://github.com/tomsanbear/xpf)

An implementation of the XPF record for CoreDNS, useful for CoreDNS to act as a DNS proxy and forward client information.

## [CoreDNS Logging](https://github.com/tomsanbear/dnslogging)
