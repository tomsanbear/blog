## Fiction

[Tiamat's Wrath (James S.A. Corey)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28335698-tiamat-s-wrath)

Having been a huge fan of *The Expanse* series since it first came out, I finally had a chance to get a copy of this book over here in Japan. 

## Non-Fiction

[The Wars of Afghanistan (Peter Tompsen)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11331856-the-wars-of-afghanistan?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=P9uCIWORxc&rank=3)

Fascinating book looking into the history of the middle east and how it contributed to the events of our modern society.

## Technical/Software

[Accelerate (Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=wZIRmrFEZ5&rank=5)

I am way overdue finally cracking this book, it was recommended to me by my previous boss, and has some great insights to the world of efficient software delivery!
